       <br>
       Junji Ito was born in Nakatsugawa, Japan on July 31, 1963. From a very young age, Ito had an interest in the horror genre. When he was only 4 or 5 years old, he started reading horror manga by Kazuo Umezu and Shinichi Koga alongside his two older sisters. As a child, Ito was also inspired by classic horror movies like Dracula and Frankenstein and occult films like Suspiria.
       <br>
       Shortly after his discovery of horror manga, Ito decided to try to make some himself. "I took a pencil and paper, or sometimes the back of advertisements, and would draw frames, imitating the manga I had read," Ito explained in an interview with Grape. "So, I started before I even entered elementary school. It was just for fun, of course. That was how I began."
       <br>
       As a young adult, Ito pursued a career in dentistry, but continued to draw horror manga as a hobby. But after three years of working as a dental technician, Ito left the dental field to become a full-time mangaka.
